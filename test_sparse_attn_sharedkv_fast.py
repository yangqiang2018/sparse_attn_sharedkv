"""Fast small-shape prefill correctness tests for the TileLang SparseAttnSharedKV port.

The full suite (``test_sparse_attn_sharedkv.py``) runs the three prefill cases
at ``S1=8192``; the CPU golden reference takes minutes at that size, which makes
the kernel-development correctness loop slow. This file runs the SAME three
prefill scenarios (swa / cfa / scfa, TND, B=1) through the SAME kernel code
paths at a small ``S1`` -- only the shape is shrunk (``S1`` / ``seqused_kv`` /
paged block counts). ``BI``, ``NI_ori`` / ``NI_cmp``, cube-direct, the paged
block-boundary split, and the cmp masking are all identical to the 8K cases, so
this is a faithful (just smaller) correctness gate -- and the golden costs ~100x
less, so these cases run by DEFAULT (they are NOT marked ``slow``).

Coverage at ``S1=1024`` (chosen by a paged-block audit, see ``_FAST_S1``):

* ori: 8 paged blocks. Positions 0..127 have a clamped (partial) window, 128..
  1023 a full 128-token window whose ``ori_left`` is non-block-aligned, so the
  paged block-boundary split (the is_subtile-dependent cube-direct path) fires
  across many block crossings, not just the first.
* scfa cmp: 2 paged blocks (``cmp_act_kv = S1/cmp_ratio = 256``). The topk
  indices spread across both, so the discrete gather's block-table indirection
  (``idx // cmp_block_size`` selecting distinct physical blocks) IS exercised --
  this is the SCFA-specific path that an S1=256 shrink would have dropped
  (cmp_act_kv=64 -> 1 block -> no inter-block indirection).
* cfa cmp: 1 block -- but cfa's ``cmp_act_kv = S1/128`` is small at every size,
  so the 8K suite is ALSO single-block here; nothing is lost vs --runslow.
* metadata: ~43 query positions per core across all cores, so the multi-core
  load-balanced scheduling is exercised (an S1=256 shrink under-fills cores).

The only thing the 8K (--runslow) suite still adds over this is block-count
*diversity* (64 ori / 16 scfa-cmp blocks vs 8 / 2 here) -- the same code paths
with more distinct blocks, not new logic. Keep --runslow as the full-scale gate.

The 8K cases in ``test_sparse_attn_sharedkv.py`` are untouched -- run them with
``--runslow`` before a release or when the tiling/shapes change. This file is
the fast inner loop; that file is the full-scale gate.

    pytest -q test_sparse_attn_sharedkv_fast.py        # fast prefill correctness

All inputs, the CPU golden, the metadata+kernel runner, and the tolerance checks
are reused verbatim from ``test_sparse_attn_sharedkv`` -- only the shapes differ.

# Small S1 for the fast golden. Chosen by a paged-block coverage audit, NOT just

# the 8K suite hits is still hit here.
#   - scfa needs cmp_act_kv = S1/cmp_ratio > block_size2 (=128) so the topk
#     indices span >= 2 cmp blocks and the discrete gather's block-table
#     indirection is exercised. cmp_ratio=4 => S1 > 512; S1=1024 gives 2 blocks.
#   - ori boundary split + multi-core scheduling want several blocks / a full
#     core fan-out; S1=1024 gives 8 ori blocks and ~43 positions/core.
# Golden cost stays small (~0.4-0.9s/case warm), so the loop is still ~100x

# --runslow 8K gate); lowering below 1024 silently drops the scfa multi-block
